            - Create an ngrok configuration file `ngrok.yml` as follows:
                ```yaml
                authtoken: %replace_with_auth_token_from_dashboard%
                tunnels:
                signaling:

                    proto: tcp
                ```
            - Start ngrok: `ngrok http https://localhost:44379 -host-header=localhost`. You will see an output like this:
                ```ymal
